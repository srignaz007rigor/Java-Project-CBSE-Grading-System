# Java-Project-CBSE-Grading-System
My first Java Project.
After running this file on your laptop, you will get your total marks, cpga, and percentage.
The code uses a simple if else if block with a scanner package.
The logic used here will ensure that a student cannot enter bad data (marks more significant than 100 will not be accepted, and an error message "The Marks entered is invalid! Should not exceed 100." will appear on the screen).
The program will terminate if bad data is entered, and the student will have to rerun the program again, to get his/her cgpa.

Note: You need to have a JDK installed to run this project.
